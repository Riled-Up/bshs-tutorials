# Try to make a script that makes a madlib.
# First, ask the user for things like adjectives and nouns.
# Then, put them in the format of a story.

# For example, you might first ask the user to input an adjective and a noun
# and then insert them into a story or sentence you've already written.

# The last part of the script might go something like this:
print("I was walking down the street whenever I saw a " + adjective1 + ' ' + noun1 +
      " come out of nowhere!")

# Make it as long as you want.
