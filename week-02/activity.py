# Your goal is to make a script that takes in the title of a song and
# makes it all uppercase and switches some letters for others.

# These are the things you have to change about each letter in the title.
# lowercase -> uppercase
# I -> 1
# B -> 13
# S -> Z

# Here are some examples:
# business -> 13UZ1NEZZ
# bois -> 13O1Z
# clout cobain -> CLOUT CO13A1N

# A quick way to make an entire string uppercase is to do
exampleString = "bshs"
exampleString = exampleString.upper()
